# Elevation Profile Interpolation (Python)

A short project completed during the **Computer Science studies** for the **Numerical Methods** course.  
It focuses on reconstructing elevation profiles using two interpolation techniques: **Lagrange polynomial** and **cubic splines**.

## About the Project

The goal of this project was to evaluate how different interpolation methods handle terrain elevation data,  
based on two real-world examples: a descending mountain trail in Slovakia and a steep route in Greece.

Two techniques were implemented from scratch:
- Lagrange polynomial interpolation
- Natural cubic spline interpolation

The project compares how both methods perform under:
- different point distributions (regular vs irregular)
- various amounts of input data
- noisy data
